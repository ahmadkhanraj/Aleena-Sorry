    <h1>Our Little Moments 💕</h1>
    
    <p>There are countless small memories that make our friendship special.  
    The random jokes, silly arguments, and late-night rants, every bit of it means something to me. 🌙</p>

    <p>Even when you roast me, I still end up smiling 😅  
    Because somehow, you make even my worst days lighter.  
    You’re honestly the best part of my boring life!</p>

    <p>A small misunderstanding almost got me in trouble,  
    but, you <strong>Aleena Khan</strong> stepped in, took the blame, and handled everything calmly, 
    a true friend who saved me when it mattered most. 💪💖</p>

    <p>And no matter what happens, you always take my side,   
    even when everyone else stands against me.  
    That’s something I’ll never forget, Aleena. You’re rare, genuine, and one of a kind. 💫</p>

    <p>I don’t say this enough, but I really appreciate you,   
    for being patient, for understanding me, and for staying even when I act dumb sometimes 🙈</p>
